# First day instructions

A few instructions as you start out.

* Read the [pair programming chapter][pair-programming] before
  starting.
* Use SublimeText, already installed. **No exceptions**. We all use
  the same text editor, even if you have experience with something
  else. We need both members of the pair to be comfortable switching
  editors.
* Do not use your own computer. Do not use your cell phone. Work
  together with your pair.
* Each day create your own directory for code (call the first one
  `w1d1`).
* Read the chapter on [code reviews][code-reviews] before 6PM (that's
  when your code is due to be submitted).

* Pomodoro
*
