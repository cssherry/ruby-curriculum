# Pair programming

## How to pair
In pair programming, two programmers work together at one
workstation. The *driver* writes the code while the *observer* reviews
the code, makes suggestions, and looks for bugs. The two programmers
switch roles frequently; you should switch every ten minutes.

The foundation and whole point of pair programming is
communication. The driver must not just begin typing code, they must
talk to the observer and together agree on what to do. The observer
must always understand what the driver intends to do next. If not, it
is the observer's responsibility to stop the driver and ask.

## Benefits of pair programming
There are a number of reasons we pair:

1. Pairs are a second pair of eyes. Since most novice mistakes are
   trivial, your pair has a great chance of immediately identifying a
   problem that could have otherwise taken you a long time to
   discover.
2. Every student will learn different things outside of class; pairing
   is a way to bring that knowledge back into the class and share it
   with other students. This is one of the reasons we pair
   "promiscuously" (new pairs every project); we want everyone to
   benefit from everyone else's experience.
3. It is important to maintain focus throughout the class day. Working
   solo, it is easy to become distracted or zone out. Working in
   pairs, students help keep each other honest.
4. Working with other people is fun; we do a lot of coding, and it
   ought to be enjoyable.

## Pitfalls of pair programming

There are a few major pitfalls to avoid when pair programming:

1. Switch regularly, every ten minutes! If the driver doesn't stop,
   the observer must stop them.
2. The driver must not go off and start typing on his own, he should
   coordinate what he is doing with the observer. Avoid being a
   domineering driver.
3. Likewise, the observer must be engaged, must ask plenty of
   questions, and must be comfortable making suggestions. Avoid being
   a passive observer.
