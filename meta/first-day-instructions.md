# First day instructions

A few instructions as you start out.

* Read the [pair programming chapter][pair-programming] before
  starting.
* Use SublimeText, already installed. **No exceptions**. We all use
  the same text editor, even if you have experience with something
  else. We need both members of the pair to be comfortable switching
  editors.
    * In general, don't use technologies that your partner doesn't
      know; you'll make them helpless. This really makes me angry if
      you do this, so please do not.
* Turn off your personal machine and cell phone. We do not allow their
  use.
* Each day create your own directory for code (call the first one
  `w1d1`).
