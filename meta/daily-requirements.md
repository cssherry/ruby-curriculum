# Daily requirements

## tl;dr

* Read next day's readings. Review, but don't do, the exercises
  (they're for in class the next day).
* Submit at least two questions on readings to
  questions@appacademy.io by 9am.
* Make two curriculum contributions on the github.
* Send code to your partners for review; review their code.
* Write your daily reflection.

## Readings and Q&A

* Instead of formal lectures, we have readings to be completed after
  class.
* We will occasionally have code demos.
* At the beginning of each day, we will have a Q&A session.
* You are required to submit (at least) two Q&A questions to
  questions@appacademy.io by 9am.

## Curriculum contributions

* Each day, you are required to submit two material contributions to
  the curriculum. Accepted contributions include:
    * Additional explanatory text,
    * new (high quality) references,
    * writing an exercise
    * Spelling and typographical corrections are welcome, but don't
      count toward your quota.
* You may modify our curriculum directly on github by clicking on the
  'edit' button.
* The text is formatted in [Markdown][markdown]; read up on that so
  your contributions are formatted correctly.
    * Make sure you are signed in as the proper user when editing.

## Code reviews

* Code reviews are required; you must send your code to your partner
  pair at the end of class (6PM). Do not send your code late.
* Read the [code review instructions][code-reviews]

[code-reviews]: ./code-reviews.md

## Daily reflection

* Write a daily learning reflection each day.
* Create a Tumblr to log your reflections.
* You should detail what you've learned that day.
* Daily reflections are a very important component of the class.
  * Summarizing what you have learned will help solidify your
    knowledge of the material.
  * It gives us feedback which will make the course better for you and
    other students.
  * Your reflection will also help in the hiring process: you will
    have a detailed record of what you have learned and how quickly
    you have learned it to show employers.
* Fine for not completing the daily reflection is $10/day.
