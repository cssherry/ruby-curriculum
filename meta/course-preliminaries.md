## Project questions
**TODO: review**
* Push your code to github.
* Add app-academy as a collaborator.
* Create a github issue, assigning it to app-academy.
* We'll look at the issue and then come over.
* We may tell you to writeup the solution and add it to the wiki.
  * **TODO: create a wiki page for each project's best bugs**

## Code reviews
**TODO: review**
* After each assignment, we'll assign pairs to code review each others
  work.
* Your responsibility is to give feedback in how they could improve
  their code. This includes not only errors, but style and anything
  else that improves code quality.
* This will help you keep in mind that good code is written so that it
  can be read later: write readable code!

## Daily reflection
* Write a daily learning reflection each day.
* Create a Tumblr to log your reflections.
* You should detail what you've learned that day.
* Daily reflections are a very important component of the class.
  * Summarizing what you have learned will help solidify your
    knowledge of the material.
  * It gives us feedback which will make the course better for you and
    other students.
  * Your reflection will also help in the hiring process: you will
    have a detailed record of what you have learned and how quickly
    you have learned it to show employers.
* Fine for not completing the daily reflection is $10/day.

## Curriculum contributions
**TODO: review**
* Each day, make (at least) one contribution to the
  curriculum. Potential contributions include:
  * Correcting typos
  * Clarifying exposition
  * Adding (quality) references
  * Writing an exercise
* Fork the curriculum repo and make a commit
  * Starting week two
  * In week one, just email ned@ your contribution.
* Fine for not completing contributions is $10

## Assessments
* Assessments are intended to give you early feedback so you know
  whether you are keeping up.
* Assessments are given every Monday, in class. They take about an
  hour.
* Assessments are done solo.
* Assessment material contains no surprises; master the "Goals"
  sections of each reading and you'll be in good shape.
* Students who fail two assessments may be asked to leave the program.

## General advice
* Push yourself hard
  * Previous course was very successful, most everyone got jobs, but
    keep in mind, average workweek was ~80hrs.
  * We schedule two breaks in addition to lunch so that people stay
    loose.
  * Please don't take unscheduled breaks without asking.
  * Please return on-time from breaks: lateness penalties apply.
* Greatest risk is that you fall behind and don't receive help
  promptly.
  * The course moves quickly and builds on previous material, you
    can't afford to fall behind.
  * If you start to fall behind, you need to take action quickly.
  * The best way to catch up is to find people to spend extra time
    working with. We'll try to help, but you also need to be
    proactive in this.
  * If you fall behind, you may need to spend extra time studying
    until you catch up.
* You need to ask questions
  * If an instructor writes a line of code you don't understand, you
    *have* to ask what it means.
  * If an instructor explains something but it doesn't make sense, you
    *have* to say so.
  * We'll try to make sure you understand what we teach, but we need
    your help, too.
* Start work early!
  * It's hard to estimate how long something may take; everyone works
    at a different pace.
  * Make sure you start early, so that you don't get stuck behind
    schedule.
  * Example: many students started the prepwork too late.
