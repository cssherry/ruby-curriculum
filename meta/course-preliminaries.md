## Pairing

Almost 100% of project time is spent in pairs; pairs are assigned by
us each morning. Read [how to pair](pair-programming.md) so that you
pair effectively.

## Lectures
* Instead of forma lectures, we have readings to be completed after
  class.
* We will occasionally have code demos.
* At the beginning of each day, we will have a Q&A session.
* You are required to submit (at least) two Q&A questions the evening
  before to questions@appacademy.io.

## Curriculum contributions
* Each day, you are required to submit two material contributions to
  the curriculum.
    * (1) Additional explanatory text,
    * (2) new (high quality) references,
    * (3) writing an exercise
    * Spelling and typographical corrections are welcome, but don't
      count toward your quota.
* You may modify our curriculum directly on github by clicking on the
  'edit' button.
* The text is formatted in [Markdown][markdown]; read up on that so
  your contributions are formatted correctly.
    * Make sure you are signed in as the proper user when editing.

## Code reviews
* When we assign pairs, we also assign pairs of pairs that will review
  each other's code.
* Code review will be part of every student's assignment for the
  evening.
* Your responsibility is to give feedback in how to improve the
  code. This includes not only errors, but style and anything else
  that improves code quality.
* Code for review must be sent at class end (6PM). Don't send late
  code for review, because your review-pair needs to go to sleep.
* In the first week, pairs exchange their code through zip file and
  email.
* Reviewers should annotate the source code with their comments and
  suggestions. They should email their comments back, copying
  instructors@appacademy.io.
* Beginning at the start of week two, students will email reviewers a
  link to their github.
* Reviewers will fork the github, create a branch named "review", and
  commit their comments to this branch.
* Reviewers should then email their github back, copying
  instructors@appacademy.io.

## Daily reflection
* Write a daily learning reflection each day.
* Create a Tumblr to log your reflections.
* You should detail what you've learned that day.
* Daily reflections are a very important component of the class.
  * Summarizing what you have learned will help solidify your
    knowledge of the material.
  * It gives us feedback which will make the course better for you and
    other students.
  * Your reflection will also help in the hiring process: you will
    have a detailed record of what you have learned and how quickly
    you have learned it to show employers.
* Fine for not completing the daily reflection is $10/day.

## Assessments
* Assessments are intended to give you early feedback so you know
  whether you are keeping up.
* Assessments are given every Monday, in class. They take about an
  hour.
* Assessments are done solo.
* Assessment material contains no surprises; master the "Goals"
  sections of each reading and you'll be in good shape.
* Students who fail two assessments may be asked to leave the program.

## General advice
* Push yourself hard
  * Previous course was very successful, most everyone got jobs, but
    keep in mind, average workweek was ~80hrs.
  * We schedule two breaks in addition to lunch so that people stay
    loose.
  * Please don't take unscheduled breaks without asking.
  * Please return on-time from breaks: lateness penalties apply.
* Greatest risk is that you fall behind and don't receive help
  promptly.
  * The course moves quickly and builds on previous material, you
    can't afford to fall behind.
  * If you start to fall behind, you need to take action quickly.
  * The best way to catch up is to find people to spend extra time
    working with. We'll try to help, but you also need to be
    proactive in this.
  * If you fall behind, you may need to spend extra time studying
    until you catch up.
* You need to ask questions
  * If an instructor writes a line of code you don't understand, you
    *have* to ask what it means.
  * If an instructor explains something but it doesn't make sense, you
    *have* to say so.
  * We'll try to make sure you understand what we teach, but we need
    your help, too.
* Start work early!
  * It's hard to estimate how long something may take; everyone works
    at a different pace.
  * Make sure you start early, so that you don't get stuck behind
    schedule.
  * Example: many students started the prepwork too late.
