## General advice

* Push yourself hard
  * Previous course was very successful, most everyone got jobs, but
    keep in mind, average workweek was ~80hrs.
  * We schedule two breaks in addition to lunch so that people stay
    loose.
  * Please don't take unscheduled breaks without asking.
  * Please return on-time from breaks: lateness penalties apply.
* Greatest risk is that you fall behind and don't receive help
  promptly.
  * The course moves quickly and builds on previous material, you
    can't afford to fall behind.
  * If you start to fall behind, you need to take action quickly.
  * The best way to catch up is to find people to spend extra time
    working with. We'll try to help, but you also need to be
    proactive in this.
  * If you fall behind, you may need to spend extra time studying
    until you catch up.
* You need to ask questions
  * If an instructor writes a line of code you don't understand, you
    *have* to ask what it means.
  * If an instructor explains something but it doesn't make sense, you
    *have* to say so.
  * We'll try to make sure you understand what we teach, but we need
    your help, too.
* Start work early!
  * It's hard to estimate how long something may take; everyone works
    at a different pace.
  * Make sure you start early, so that you don't get stuck behind
    schedule.
  * Example: many students started the prepwork too late.
