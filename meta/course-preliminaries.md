## Reporting difficulties with projects

Instructors are here to help you get unstuck quickly, but we must
balance that with the importance of learning to diagnose and solve
your own problems.

If you are stuck, you should send an email to
`questions@appacademy.io` describing your problem. You should describe
your problem and copy the relevant source code. You should also inform
others of your solution.

## Code reviews
* When we assign pairs, we also assign pairs of pairs that will review
  each other's code.
* Code review will be part of every student's assignment for the
  evening.
* Your responsibility is to give feedback in how to improve the
  code. This includes not only errors, but style and anything else
  that improves code quality.
* Code for review must be sent at class end (6PM). Don't send late
  code for review, because your review-pair needs to go to sleep.
* In the first week, pairs will exchange their code through zip file
  and email.
* Reviewers should annotate the source code with their comments and
  suggestions. They should email their comments back, copying
  instructors@appacademy.io.
* Beginning at the start of week two, students will email reviewers a
  link to their github.
* Reviewers will fork the github, create a branch named "review", and
  commit their comments to this branch.
* Reviewers should then email their github back, copying
  instructors@appacademy.io.

## Daily reflection
* Write a daily learning reflection each day.
* Create a Tumblr to log your reflections.
* You should detail what you've learned that day.
* Daily reflections are a very important component of the class.
  * Summarizing what you have learned will help solidify your
    knowledge of the material.
  * It gives us feedback which will make the course better for you and
    other students.
  * Your reflection will also help in the hiring process: you will
    have a detailed record of what you have learned and how quickly
    you have learned it to show employers.
* Fine for not completing the daily reflection is $10/day.

## Curriculum contributions
* Each day, you are required to make one contribution to the
  curriculum (at least!). Potential contributions include:
  * Correcting typos
  * Clarifying exposition
  * Adding (quality) references
  * Writing an exercise
* Fork the curriculum repo and make a commit; ask ruggeri to pull your
  change.
  * In week one, just email your contribution to
    instructors@appacademy.io.

## Assessments
* Assessments are intended to give you early feedback so you know
  whether you are keeping up.
* Assessments are given every Monday, in class. They take about an
  hour.
* Assessments are done solo.
* Assessment material contains no surprises; master the "Goals"
  sections of each reading and you'll be in good shape.
* Students who fail two assessments may be asked to leave the program.

## General advice
* Push yourself hard
  * Previous course was very successful, most everyone got jobs, but
    keep in mind, average workweek was ~80hrs.
  * We schedule two breaks in addition to lunch so that people stay
    loose.
  * Please don't take unscheduled breaks without asking.
  * Please return on-time from breaks: lateness penalties apply.
* Greatest risk is that you fall behind and don't receive help
  promptly.
  * The course moves quickly and builds on previous material, you
    can't afford to fall behind.
  * If you start to fall behind, you need to take action quickly.
  * The best way to catch up is to find people to spend extra time
    working with. We'll try to help, but you also need to be
    proactive in this.
  * If you fall behind, you may need to spend extra time studying
    until you catch up.
* You need to ask questions
  * If an instructor writes a line of code you don't understand, you
    *have* to ask what it means.
  * If an instructor explains something but it doesn't make sense, you
    *have* to say so.
  * We'll try to make sure you understand what we teach, but we need
    your help, too.
* Start work early!
  * It's hard to estimate how long something may take; everyone works
    at a different pace.
  * Make sure you start early, so that you don't get stuck behind
    schedule.
  * Example: many students started the prepwork too late.
