# Code reviews
* When we assign pairs, we also assign pairs of pairs that will review
  each other's code.
* Code review will be part of every student's assignment for the
  evening.
* Your responsibility is to give feedback in how to improve the
  code. This includes not only errors, but style and anything else
  that improves code quality.
* Code for review must be sent at class end (6PM). Don't send late
  code for review, because your review-pair needs to go to sleep.
* In the first week, pairs exchange their code through zip file and
  email.
* Reviewers should annotate the source code with their comments and
  suggestions. They should email their comments back, copying
  instructors@appacademy.io.
* Beginning at the start of week two, students will email reviewers a
  link to their github.
* Reviewers will fork the github, create a branch named "review", and
  commit their comments to this branch.
* Reviewers should then email their github back, copying
  instructors@appacademy.io.
