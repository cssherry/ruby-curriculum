# Twitter Client

**TODO: Facebook project as well?**

We'll use the [Twitter API][api-docs] to build a command line Twitter
API.

* Post a status
* Get your timeline
* Get statuses for users
* Direct message other users

Hint: you will eventually need to set your app to ask to both read and
post on your users' behalf. This is a key benefit of OAuth: a
gradation of permission levels.

You will want to use the [OAuth gem][oauth-github].
