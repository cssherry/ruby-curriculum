# Test Driven Development

* w1d1 exercises TDD
    * Especially Towers of Hanoi
* fibs
* TreeNode TDD
    * Implement `bfs` (not `dfs`) and make sure path returned is
      shortest.
    * You don't need to otherwise test that the nodes are searched in
      any particular order; specs should test what is done, not how.
* TicTacToe
    * Use test doubles when testing `HumanPlayer` and
      `ComputerPlayer`.
