# Test Driven Development

* Re-do w1d1 Array exercises TDD.
    * That means writing specs alongside code.
    * For Towers of Hanoi, focus on non-UI stuff first.
        * `#render`
        * `#move`
        * `#won?`
* TreeNode TDD
    * Implement `bfs` and `dfs`.
    * Test that nodes are visited in the right order.
    * That is a sort of weird test
